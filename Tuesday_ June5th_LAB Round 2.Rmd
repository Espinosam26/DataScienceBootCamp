### Working w/ Flat Files 

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r}
?read_csv
```
### Writing CSV

```{r}
write_cars <- as.data.frame(mtcars)
```
```{r}
write_csv(write_cars, path = "cars.csv")
```


### Excel
** Read from Excel - readxl **
To import data from Excel, we actually need a different package called readxl. Install readxl and then call readxl. Go!

```{r}
install.packages("readxl")
```

Call by using the library()

```{r}
library(readxl)
```

readxl comes with some examples which you can practice with. Call these examples in with readxl_example()

```{r}
readxl_example("deaths.xls")
```

```{r}
?read_excel
```

```{r}
xl_example <- readxl_example("deaths.xls")
```

```{r}
xls_example <- readxl_example("deaths.xlsx")
```

```{r}
read_excel(xl_example)
```

```{r}
read_excel(xls_example)
```

```{r}
read_excel(xls_example, skip = 4)
```
Note: Now the chart skips the unecessary rows at at the top of the chart.

The excel_sheets() function will return the name of the sheets in the Excel workbook.

```{r}
excel_sheets(xl_example)
```

### Write to Excel- writexl

```{r}
install.packages("writexl")
```
Not sure what that error message above means?

```{r}
library(writexl)
```

```{r}
write_xlsx(mtcars, path = 'cars.xlsx')
```

### Excercises 

The following exercises will require you to explore some of the functions provided by readr to answer the questions.

```{r}
?readr
```

1.What function would you use to read a file where fields were separated with |?
    + read_tsv()
    
2.Apart from file, skip, and comment, what other arguments do read_csv() and read_tsv() have in common?
```{r}
?read.csv
```
Below are two additional examples of arguments that read_csv and read_tsv both have

**header**	
a logical value indicating whether the file contains the names of the variables as its first line. If missing, the value is determined from the file format: header is set to TRUE if and only if the first row contains one fewer field than the number of columns.
**sep**	
the field separator character. Values on each line of the file are separated by this character. If sep = "" (the default for read.table) the separator is ‘white space’, that is one or more spaces, tabs, newlines or carriage returns.

3.What are the most important arguments to read_fwf()?
    + file, col_positions, col_types
    
### Open Miami-Dade Data Lab   

```{r}
service_data <- read_csv("311_Service_Requests_-_Miami-Dade_County.csv")
```

```{r}
library(janitor)
colnames(service_data)
```

```{r}
service_data <- clean_names(service_data)
```

```{r}
colnames(service_data)
```

**How many rows and columns are in this data?**
```{r}
dim(service_data)
```
ROW: 657544 COLUMN: 23

**How many cities are represented in the data?**

```{r}
install.packages("Hmisc")
```

```{r}
library(Hmisc)
```

```{r}
describe(service_data)
```

```{r}
unique(service_data$city)
```

Answer: there are 36 cities included in "service.data" because one city was marked NA

**What is the most frequently occuring issue type? Hint: Use the table function.**

```{r}
library(Hmisc)
```

```{r}
table(service_data$issue_type)
```

**Answer**
PET ACCOUNT UPDATE 
55455 

### OR you can do this... 

```{r}
summary(as.data.frame(service_data$issue_type))
```

Create a dataframe with the frequencies of each Ticket Status and their percentage from the whole. What percentage of tickets have a status of ‘CLOSED’? Name the columns and save the output as a csv titled ticket_status.csv

```{r}
ticket_status<-as.data.frame(service_data$ticket_status)
```

```{r}
tickets <- table(service_data$ticket_status) %>%
as.data.frame()
```

```{r}
colnames(tickets) <- c('Status', 'Count')
```

```{r}
colnames(tickets)
```

```{r}
tickets$Count
```

```{r}
tickets$Percentage <- tickets$Count / sum(tickets$Count)
```

```{r}
tickets
```
## What percentage of tickets have a status of ‘CLOSED’? 
There are multiple ways of finding this answer. Please see above and below for both approaches. One required us to create a data frame and the other used the function describe alongside the argument of a specific variable "ticket_status"

```{r}
describe(service_data$ticket_status)
```

## Name the columns and save the output as a csv titled ticket_status.csv

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
write_csv(tickets, path = "ticket_status.csv")
```

### The meat!
**You are the new manager on the 311 analysis team. You want your employees to look into tickets that were created over 30 days ago and are still open to ensure that they are being correctly classified and haven’t fallen through the cracks. You are going to create a new file with only the “overdue open tickets” so that they can be evaluated. Follow the steps below to create this new file.**

```{r}
tickets$Status
```
## 1. Change/convert the dates and times to the correct format. First check the class.

```{r}
sapply(service_data, class)
```

**Important:I need to change the data type of all the variables containing dates and times. Therefore, i need to go from a "factor" to the format of Month/Date/Year. Using the function as.Date(data set$ varibale we want to change, pipe "%m/%d/%y"). Repeat this process with all variables for consistency when using other functions.**

```{r}
service_data$ticket_last_updated_date_time <- as.Date(service_data$ticket_last_updated_date_time, "%m/%d/%Y") 
```
# next...
```{r}
service_data$ticket_created_date_time <- as.Date(service_data$ticket_created_date_time, "%m/%d/%Y")
```
#next...
```{r}
service_data$ticket_closed_date_time <- as.Date(service_data$ticket_closed_date_time, "%m/%d/%Y")
```
# Check to make sure all data types have been converted.
```{r}
sapply(service_data, class)
```

**Note: As you can see above, all the variables containing dates are no longer "characters" but rather "dates" data type.**

## 2.Create a new variable, open_30, with only tickets that are OPEN and were created more than 30 days ago.

```{r}
rm(open_30)
```
```{r}
rm(overdue_tickets)
```
## Below is a from of subsetting.
```{r}
open_30 <- service_data[service_data$ticket_status=='OPEN',]
```

Note: Now that i have isolated the 'OPEN' tickets i need to remove the time stamp from the variable ticket_created_date_time using Sys.Date()

```{r}
open_30 <- service_data[service_data$ticket_status == 'OPEN' & service_data$ticket_created_date_time < Sys.Date() - 30,]
```
**note: Sys.Date() without anything inside the parenthesis will always = todays date**
```{r}
open_30
```

## How many rows do you have in your new open_30 variable?
```{r}
str(service_data)
```

```{r}
dim(open_30)
```
**Note: there are 3953 rows/ observations  in open_30**


We actually have a different number of days as a goal depending on the type of issue, and you decide that even though some tickets have been open for more than 30 days, if the goal is greater than 30 days, you won’t worry about those yet. Create a new variable as part of your dataset for the number of days the ticket has been open.

```{r}
unique(service_data$goal_days)
```

Create a new variable overdue and only keep the issues that are greater than 30 days and are over the goal days.

```{r}
open_30$days_open <- as.integer(Sys.Date() - open_30$ticket_created_date_time)
```
Note: 

```{r}
open_30$days_open
```

```{r}
summary(open_30$days_open)
```


Write the overdue dataset to a new csv called Overdue_Tickets.csv


How do the issue types in these overdue tickets compare to the entire list of issues?
Commit your R Notebook with the documented workflow and push it up to your Github page. (Heads up: Your Overdue_Tickets.csv file should be significantly smaller than the original file, make sure you do not commit and attempt to push any file larger than 100MB to your github page.)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
